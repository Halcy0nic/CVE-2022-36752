# Description for CVE-2022-36752

png2webp v1.0.4 was discovered to contain an out-of-bounds write via the function w2p. This vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted png file.

# Reproduction

To reproduce the vulnerability, download the vulnerable version of png2webp (v1.0.4) and compile the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/landfillbaby/png2webp.git
cd png2webp
git submodule update --init --depth 1
git checkout 0c7119109cde91127a263bf0af252e5e730f7fba
./configure && make
